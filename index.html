                        </h2>
                        <p class="lead">In our dataset, there is information on neighborhood, neighborhood group, room type, minimum number of days, and more that correlate with each other in intriguing ways. Our goal is to predict the price of an Airbnb listing in New York City, which will be measured in US dollars. </p>

                        </h2> <p class="lead"> Currently, it is very popular to place a property on the Airbnb market to make some extra cash and even have a career if one owns a very nice property. Given this trend, we were inspired to create a machine learning model that can help potential hosts and tourists alike. It can help potential hosts decide whether it would be profitable to place their property on the market given its location, room type, and more. As for the tourists, they can use our model to verify that the renting price is reasonable. Another final justification was that this was a viable data set, large enough for us to ensure reasonably accurate results, but not so large that our computers could still handle it without crashing.</p>

                        <p class="lead">The majority of prices and reviews is under $1000 and less than 75 reviews. The Bronx (orange) has the cheapest listings while Manhattan (red) has the most expensive listings. As for the other boroughs, Staten Island (purple), Queens (green), and Brooklyn (blue) had increasing number of reviews and prices in that order. </p>

                        <p class="lead">Initially, we thought that availability would have a distinct effect on the price because of seasonal demand. However, we were wrong. In this scatter plot, we can see that it does not matter how available the listing is as it does not affect the price. This graph also reaffirms that the most expensive listings are in Manhattan while the cheapest listings are in the Bronx.</p>

There was a slightly positive correlation between reviews per month and number of reviews.</p>

                        <p class="lead">This graph shows the minimum, maximum, and median prices of a listing in each of the boroughs. Overall, all of these box plots are top skewed. The median is typically between 65 and 141 for the different boroughs. The medians further confirm that Manhattan is typically the most expensive borough as opposed to the Bronx being the cheapest borough. There are also apparent outliers for all of the boroughs that would matter for the machine learning models.</p>

                        <p class="lead">First, we tried a baseline linear regression model. This model basically uses a line to predict the price of the Airbnb. Linear regression assumes that all features have a linear relation with price of an Airbnb in New York City, so we can fit a line of best fit to predict future values. After testing the model with our dataset, we got a root mean square error of 74 which isn't great as most of our values got to around 40 and the higher the RMSE is, the worse it is. However, it's still not terrible.</p>
